# proyecto-hackaboss

I´m gonna upload all my progress in the hackaboss porject i´m working for.

It will have various parts:

  Database (DONE)
  Back-end (DONE)
  In development - (React based api). I'm currently trying to simulate how it would be to adapt the project already done to a template provided by a client.
